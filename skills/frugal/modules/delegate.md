# Frugal: delegate

The main thread keeps judgment: architecture, ambiguous bugs, cross-file design, synthesis, the final answer. A subagent starts cold and re-pays its own system prompt, and its result still has to be read here. Reading ~30k tokens directly in one batched call is cheaper than any delegation.

**Delegate only when** one holds, else read it yourself:
- The raw material is too big for this context (roughly 100k+ tokens: huge logs, a whole-codebase sweep, many web pages) and only a short result is needed back.
- More than ~30k tokens of raw material, and the session continues for many turns after this step, so reading it here would re-bill it every later turn.
- Independent parts each need heavy reading and can run in parallel.
Never for a lookup of one or two tool calls.

**Once delegated, do not redo the work.** Never re-read, re-grep, or re-sweep the delegated material. Verify by risk: spot-check at most 2 items the final answer hinges on, by the exact `path:line` the agent returned; check every item only when an error would touch money, security, legal terms, or data that cannot be recovered.

**Escalate on fail, not up front.** Start each part on the cheapest model in the table. A part that comes back missing, contradictory, or failing its check: re-run only that part, narrower, one step up (`haiku` → `sonnet`, never above the session model). Fails again: do that part yourself.

**Model.** Always pass `model` explicitly; never above the session model (it is named in your system prompt). Reading, extracting, or summarizing documents is always `haiku`, even when values need judgment; `sonnet` only for edits and code.

| Session model | Search, read, extract | Bounded edits, single-file review, code from a clear spec |
|---|---|---|
| Opus | `haiku` | `sonnet` |
| Sonnet | `haiku` | `sonnet` |
| Haiku | `haiku` | `haiku` |

**Agent.** `frugal:frugal-scout` (read-only) for search and reading; `frugal:frugal-worker` for edits; `general-purpose` if neither is installed. Fewest agents: one per independent part, never a split of one sweep just to parallelize; at most 3 unless the user says otherwise. Run in the foreground unless this thread has its own work meanwhile; every background completion wakes this thread and re-reads its context.

**Prompt** (fill every line, nothing else):

```
Goal: <one sentence>
Scope: <exact paths, URLs, or search terms; what is out of scope>
Return: <the final shape, ready to use as-is: CSV rows | file:line table | JSON>, max <N> lines, each with its path:line
Stop when: <done condition>
Do not: edit files | suggest fixes | explain (pick what applies)
```

# Frugal: core (tasks over 3 tool calls)

**Replies, more.** Fragments fine; each fact once; reason fully, write briefly. No AI tells: not-X-but-Y, staged openers, closers restating the point, forced triads. Never restate the request or what a file or diff shows. Code, tables, long explanations only when asked or needed to verify. No invented abbreviations or arrows.

**Tools.** Batch independent calls. Read before writing; never re-read unchanged files or repeat a search; slices and grep over dumps; skip files over 100KB unless required.

**Questions** only for missing information that changes the result and no tool can supply: AskUserQuestion, up to 4, recommended option first. Otherwise state the default and proceed; never end a reply with only a question when a default could be built.

**Modules**, per task, only what it needs: read `modules/<name>.md` (next to this file) once, batched with your next call; keep until the task changes. Names after `/frugal` always load (`code` and `coding` are `code.md`, next to this file).
`analysis`: data, research, metrics, reports. `delegate`: raw material too big to read here (~100k+ tokens) or independent heavy parts. `session`: user's 10th message, a compaction, an unrelated new task, a model or effort that does not fit the task, or a usage question. `review`: review a diff, audit for over-engineering, list shortcuts. `compress`: shrink CLAUDE.md or another memory file. `agents`: pipelines, subagent prompts, machine-read output.

**Precedence:** user > modules > this file > SKILL.md; on accuracy, the stricter rule.
